Snow & Serenity Tour College Trip Web
This is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of student trip applications and approvals. Students can register and log in to submit trip applications, track their application status (pending or approved), and upload important documents such as parent consent forms, ID cards, or medical certificates. Uploaded documents are securely stored and accessible by faculty members who manage and review the submissions. The system improves communication between students and faculty by providing real-time notifications and application updates. Additionally, faculty can monitor application histories and manage approvals efficiently, ensuring smooth coordination of college trips.

The dashboard offers personalized views for students, showing their application details and upload status, while faculty members have access to all submitted documents for review. The application also supports secure authentication to protect user data and restrict access based on roles.
